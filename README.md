# Markowitz-Efficient-Portfolio
Building an Efficient Portfolio according to Markowitz Theory. Using the Capital Asset Pricing Model CAPM to evaluate stocks.

## What Is the Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)?
The modern portfolio theory (MPT) is a practical method for selecting investments in order to maximize their overall returns within an acceptable level of risk. This mathematical framework is used to build a portfolio of investments that maximize the amount of expected return for the collective given level of risk. 

A key component of the MPT theory is diversification. Most investments are either high risk and high return or low risk and low return. Markowitz argued that investors could achieve their best results by choosing an optimal mix of the two based on an assessment of their individual tolerance to risk.

## Objective: Building an efficient portfolio according to Markowitz Theory. Using the Capital Asset Pricing Model CAPM to evaluate stocks.

I collected the price of 30 stocks in the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Germany) from February 2015 to March 2021. 
How i collected it:
* Diversity of Fields: 
> FMCG: pharmaceutical and medical industry (Sartorius Stedim Biotech SA, Merck KGaA, Fresenius Medical Care KGAA ST, ...), consumer and retail    (Henkel AG & Co, Adidas, Puma, Ceconomy AG ...), energy quantity (RWE AG),...
> Fast growing industries: technology (SAP AG, Infineon Technologies AG, Fabasoft AG), Finance (Allianz SE, Vonovia SE, Deutsche Boerse AG, Deutsche Wohnen AG, Muench, Rueckvers, VNA O,N, Talanx AG NA O, N,…),...
> Long-standing and sustainable growth industries in Germany: chemical (BASF SE,..), Heavy industry (Siemens AG, TU Aero Engines NA, Continental, Thyssenkrupp AG O,N,)....

* Core German industries: Car Manufacturing : Mercedes (Daimler AG), Porsche, BMW, Volkswagen; Chemicals (BASF SE NA O,N,)...

* Financial Ratios based: Choose stocks with medium and high P/E ratios compared to the industry with the expectation of future growth. In addition, I choose based on stable and steady earnings ratios (ROE, ROA) that show the security's earnings growth and future expectations.

* The capitalization is diversified from medium to medium to large. Long-established, large-cap companies that have often moved into the sustainable development stage will form a strong foundation for the portfolio. Mid-cap companies hold great promise at the growing stage, but they also carry many risks. A mix of diversified capitalization companies will diversify portfolio risk.

* Steady growth in price and volume, high trading volume (liquidity) is also a criterion for me to choose the stocks. A good stock not only has a reasonable price line but also comes with a commensurate trading volume.
